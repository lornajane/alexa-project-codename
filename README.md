# Project Codename: an OpenWhisk Alexa Skill

This is a simple Alexa skill to show how a simple javascript function can be packaged with its dependencies and deployed to openwhisk.  To use it, deploy the action (there's a build script to help) and then set its web endpoint to be the "HTTPS" option in the Alexa Developer Console configuration for your action.
